When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Any time I want to have my work backed up in case of local data loss, or if I want to
	collaborate on a project with one or more teammates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If I'm working on something locally and someone else push pushes to the origin master,
	I would lose my work upon those commits syncing back down to my remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks are clones internal to GitHub, clones are copies of a repo either that can be
	either local or remote. Branches are different versions of a codebase within the same
	repo that are not reachable from each other. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
